# Would You Redux 2.0

A remake of the "Would You Rather" Udacity project using some cool new toys

## New Toys:

-  TailwindCSS
-  Redux Toolkit
-  NextJS
-  TypeScript

The goal of this "reboot" is not only to use newer, more sought-after technologies, but also to add extra features to the project.

## Planned additional features:

-  Create new users
-  User authentication (no more being able to sign in as anyone and everyone)
-  Delete one of your questions
-  Fun animations
-  Dark mode
